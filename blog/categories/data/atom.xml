- importing new data
- amount of code to be written (opportunities for mistake)
- separating data from scripts
- maintaining record of where data came from

Common approach
- long sequence of data modifying code

Solution
- use lookup table, find and replace
 -->

<p>In many analyses, data is read from a file, but must be modified before it can be used. For example you may want to add a new column of data, or do a “find” and “replace” on a site, treatment or species name. There are 3 ways one might add such information. The first involves editing the original data frame – although you should <em>never</em> do this, I suspect this method is quite common. A second – and widely used – approach for adding information is to modify the values using code in your script. The third – and nicest – way of adding information is to use a lookup table.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>One of the most common things we see in the code of researchers working with data are long slabs of code modifying a data frame based on some logical tests.Such code might correct, for example, a species name:</p>

<p><code>r
raw$species[raw$id=="1"] &lt;- "Banksia oblongifolia"
raw$species[raw$id=="2"] &lt;- "Banksia ericifolia"
</code></p>

<p>or add some details to the data set, such as location, latitude, longitude and mean annual precipitation:</p>

<p><code>r
raw$location[raw$id=="1"] &lt;-"NSW"
raw$latitude[raw$id=="1"] &lt;- -37
raw$longitude[raw$id=="1"] &lt;- 40
raw$map[raw$id=="1"] &lt;- 1208
raw$map[raw$id=="1"] &lt;- 1226
</code></p>

<p>In large analyses, this type of code may go for hundreds of lines.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/2013-07-09-modifying-data-with-lookup-tables/messy_script.png"></p>

<p>Now before we go on, let me say that this approach to adding data is <em>much</em> better than editing your datafile directly, for the following two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It maintains the integrity of your raw data file</li>
  <li>You can see where the new value came from (it was added in a script), and modify it later if needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also nothing <em>wrong</em> with adding data this way. However, it is what we would consider <em>messy</em> code, for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Long chunks of code modifying data is inherently difficult to read.</li>
  <li>There’s a lot of typing involved, so lot’s of work, and thus opportunities for error.</li>
  <li>It’s harder to change variable names when they are embedded in code all over the place.</li>
</ul>

<p>A far <em>nicer</em> way to add data to an existing data frame is to use a lookup table. Here is an example of such a table, achieving similar (but not identical) modifications to the code above:</p>

<p><code>r
read.csv("dataNew.csv")
</code></p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='text'>##   lookupVariable lookupValue newVariable              newValue
## 1             id           1     species  Banksia oblongifolia
## 2             id           2     species    Banksia ericifolia
## 3             id           3     species       Banksia serrata
## 4             id           4     species       Banksia grandis
## 5                         NA      family            Proteaceae
## 6                         NA    location                   NSW
## 7             id           4    location                    WA
##            source
## 1  Daniel Falster
## 2  Daniel Falster
## 3  Daniel Falster
## 4  Daniel Falster
## 5  Daniel Falster
## 6  Daniel Falster
## 7  Daniel Falster</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>The columns of this table are</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>lookupVariable</strong> is the name of the variable in the parent data we want to match against. If left  blank, change all rows.</li>
  <li><strong>lookupValue</strong> is the value of lookupVariable to match against</li>
  <li><strong>newVariable</strong> is the variable to be changed</li>
  <li><strong>newValue</strong> is the value of <code>newVariable</code> for matched rows</li>
  <li><strong>source</strong> includes any notes about where the data came from (e.g., who made the change)</li>
</ul>

<p>So the table documents the changes we want to make to our dataframe. The function <a href="https://gist.github.com/dfalster/5589956">addNewData.R</a> takes the file name for this table as an argument and applies it to the data frame. For example let’s assume we have a data frame called <code>data</code></p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='r'>myData</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='text'>##          x     y id
## 1  0.93160 5.433  1
## 2  0.24875 3.868  2
## 3  0.92273 5.944  2
## 4  0.85384 5.541  2
## 5  0.30378 3.985  2
## 6  0.41205 4.415  2
## 7  0.35158 4.440  2
## 8  0.13920 3.007  2
## 9  0.16579 2.976  2
## 10 0.66290 5.315  3
## 11 0.25720 3.755  3
## 12 0.88086 5.345  3
## 13 0.11784 3.183  3
## 14 0.01423 3.749  4
## 15 0.23359 4.264  4
## 16 0.33614 4.433  4
## 17 0.52122 4.393  4
## 18 0.11616 3.603  4
## 19 0.90871 6.379  4
## 20 0.75664 5.838  4</code></pre>
</div>
</p>

<p>and want to apply the table given above, we simply write</p>

<p><code>r
source("addNewData.r")
allowedVars &lt;- c("species", "family", "location")
addNewData("dataNew.csv", myData, allowedVars)
</code></p>

<p><div>
  <pre><code class='text'>##          x     y id              species     family location

</div>
</p>

<p>The large block of code is now reduced to a single line that clearly expresses what we want to achieve. Moreover, the new values (data) are stored as a table of <em>data</em> in a file, which is preferable to having data mixed in with our code.</p>

<p>You can use this approach
You can find the example files used here, as a <a href="https://gist.github.com/dfalster/5589956">github gist</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On a Mac, Excel produces csv files with the wrong line endings, which
causes problems for git (amongst other things).</p>

<p>This issue plagues at least
<a href="http://developmentality.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/excel-2008-for-macs-csv-bug/">Excel 2008</a>
and 2011, and possibly other versions.</p>

<p>Basically, saving a file as comma separated values (csv) uses a
carriage return <code>\r</code> rather than a line feed <code>\n</code> as a newline.  Way
back before OS X, this was actually the correct Mac file ending, but
after the move to be more unix-y, the correct line ending should be
<code>\n</code>.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Given that nothing has used this as the proper line endings for over a
decade, this is a bug.  It’s a real pity that Microsoft does not see
fit to fix it.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-a-problem">Why this is a problem</h2>

<p>This breaks a number of scripts that require specific line endings.</p>

<p>This also causes problems when version controlling your data.  In
particular, tools like <code>git diff</code> basically stop working as they work
line-by-line and see only one long line
(e.g. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11531084/strange-git-line-ending-issue">here</a>).
Not having <code>diff</code> work properly makes it really hard to see where
changes have occurred in your data.</p>

<p>Git has really nice facilities for translating between different line
endings – in particular between Windows and Unix/(new) Mac endings.
However, they do basically nothing with old-style Mac endings because
<em>no sane application should create them</em>.  See
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/convert.c#L93">here</a>, for
example.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>
<p>There are at leat two stack overflow questions that deal with this 
(<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10491564/git-and-cr-vs-lf-but-not-crlf?rq=1">1</a>
and
(<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11531084/strange-git-line-ending-issue">2</a>).</p>

<p>The solution is to edit <code>.git/config</code> (within your repository) to add
lines saying:</p>

<p><code>
[filter "cr"]
    clean = LC_CTYPE=C awk '{printf(\"%s\\n\", $0)}' | LC_CTYPE=C tr '\\r' '\\n'
    smudge = tr '\\n' '\\r'
</code></p>

<p>and then create a file <code>.gitattributes</code> that contains the line</p>

<p><code>
*.csv filter=cr
</code></p>

<p>This translates the line endings on import and back again on export
(so you never change your working file).  Things like <code>git diff</code> use
the “clean” version, and so magically start working again.</p>

<p>While the <code>.gitattributes</code> file can be (and should be) put under
version control, the <code>.git/config</code> file needs to be set up separately
on <em>every clone</em>.  There are good reasons for this (see
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6547933/is-it-possible-to-clone-git-config-from-remote-location">here</a>.
It would be possible to automate this to some degree with the
<code>--config</code> argument to <code>git clone</code>, but that’s still basically manual.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>This seems to generally work, but twice in use large numbers of files
have been marked as changed when the filter got out-of-sync.  We never
worked out what caused this, but one possible culprit seems to be
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a> (but you probably should not keep
repositories on dropbox anyway).</p>

<h2 id="alternative-solutions">Alternative solutions</h2>

<p>The nice thing about the clean/smudge solution is that it leaves files
in the working directory unmodified.  An alternative approach would be
to set up a pre-commit-hook that ran csv files through a similar
filter.  This will modify the contents of the working directory (and
may require reloading the files in Excel) but from that point on the
file will have proper line endings.</p>

<p>More manually, if files are saved as “Windows comma separated (.csv)”
you will get windows-style line endings (<code>\r\n</code>) which are at least
treated properly by git and are in common usage this century.
However, this requires more remembering and makes saving csv files
from Excel even more tricky than normal.</p>
